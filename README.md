minigrep-rs
Hey there! Welcome to minigrep-rs, a cool little command-line tool I built with Rust. Think of it like a simple, super-fast version of grep. This whole project is basically my way of getting better at Rust by making something useful and fun!

With minigrep-rs, you can easily search for text inside your files right from the terminal. It's all about clean code and doing one thing really well!

What it can do! ✨
Find what you're looking for: Just give it a word or phrase, and it'll search for it in any file.

Case doesn't matter: Use a simple flag, and it'll find your text whether it's uppercase, lowercase, or mixed!

Know where you are: It can show you the exact line number for every match it finds. Super handy!

Just the facts: If you only need to know how many times something appears, it can just give you the total count.

Handles errors gracefully: If you forget a file or type something wrong, it'll give you a helpful message instead of just crashing.

It's fast! Thanks to Rust, this thing is speedy and safe with your computer's memory.

How to Use It
Getting started is a piece of cake. First, you'll want to build the project to get the best performance.

cargo build --release

The Basic Command
Once that's done, you can run it like this from your terminal:

./target/release/minigrep-rs <what to search for> <what file to search in> [flags]

<what to search for>: The text you're trying to find.

<what file to search in>: The path to the file you want to search.

[flags]: These are optional little extras to change how it searches.

All the Awesome Flags
Here are the flags you can use to spice up your searches!

Short Flag

Long Flag

What it Does

-ic

--ignore-case

Makes your search case-insensitive.

-ln

--line-number

Shows the line number for every match.

-co

--count-only

Just shows you how many lines matched, nothing else.

Just a heads-up: You can't use the line number (-ln) and count (-co) flags at the same time. It's one or the other!

Let's See Some Examples
Imagine you have a file called poem.txt that says:

I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!
They'd banish us, you know.

A Simple Search
./target/release/minigrep-rs "nobody" poem.txt

It'll show you:

I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?

A Fancy Search (Case-Insensitive with Line Numbers!)
./target/release/minigrep-rs "Nobody" poem.txt -ic -ln

And you'll get:

I'm nobody! Who are you? (line=1)
Are you nobody, too? (line=2)

Just Counting
./target/release/minigrep-rs "us" poem.txt -co

The output is simple:

Count: 2

My Learning Adventure & What's Next 🚀
Honestly, I started this project to get a good handle on some key Rust concepts, like:

How to use structs and impl blocks

Dealing with errors using Result

Reading files from the computer

Organizing code into modules and writing tests

Figuring out how to handle command-line arguments from scratch

I'm planning to keep adding to this project as I learn new things! Here's what I'm thinking about for the future:

Make argument parsing better: I'll probably switch to the clap library to make adding new features easier.

Search more file types: Wouldn't it be cool if it could search inside PDFs?

Search the web: Maybe add a feature to pull down a webpage and search its text.

Get crazy with AI/ML: It would be awesome to use some machine learning to search for text inside of images!

Thanks for checking out my project!
